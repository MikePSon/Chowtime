Through the years the recipe has remained the same with the exception of a few tweaks here and there. When I entered fourth grade my mother went vegetarian and omitted the prosciutto. Years later when I got married I reintroduced a protein but used smoked turkey as a healthier alternative. The basil drizzle was added when we made this for my sisters engagement party just to make it a bit more fancier. Now decades later it is still a tradition at our familys Thanksgiving dinners.

She would eat them with thick and luscious toast that I later realized was her version of Texas Toast. She accompanied her glorious cumin and paprika seasoned-to-perfection steak with a side cup of coffee which made sense later on when I realized coffee and smokey steak go hand-in-hand. She always used arugula to lend a bit of peppery zip to the salad also. Genius! She told me she learned her recipe from her mother who was 92 years old when my kids were born so I am so happy that the legacy of their beautiful cooking lives on through my steak sandwich recipe. Since we live a fast-paced life that sometimes dictates we eat on the run I made their recipe into a sandwich.

After I invented a delicious cake with beans I re-considered beans as a staple in my desserts. Protein plus low carbs sounded like a good addition to some of my gluten-free treats so I went for it. And it resulted in some very filling and hard-to-resist garbanzo or Chickpea Chocolate Chip Cookies.

Her ancestors however lived in a vibrant time when spice traders from Portugal also exchanged recipes. So the Spanish invented it the Portuguese adapted it the Indians modified it and we (first generation Americans) learned it! Our Spanish-Portuguese-Indian-American hybrid flan has become a staple in our house and is requested by everyone from our neighbors to our international friends! I tend to impress everyone looking like a master chef as I scrape the fresh vanilla bean and caramelize sugar over the stove-top until its a perfect shade of gold but its actually an easy dessert to make and much lighter than other versions.

This isnt a brownie mix youve got to smooth it out. When your old tennis elbow injury starts to flare up youve probably stirred it enough. Step 3 Put the sauce aside. The trick to grilling ribs grilling not smoking is to cook them first. I know it sounds like cheating. I cook them in the oven on a broiler pan for about four hours. The ribs are rubbed with a spice mixture of random assortment and covered with aluminum foil. Its important to keep them moist so every 30 minutes or so you open the oven and pour some additional liquid in the broiler pan. I like to use a combination of water apple juice and Mountain Dew. No lie. Step 4 After the ribs are nice and tender thats when you throw them on the grill and apply your sauce in a very liberal manner. Slop that sauce on like you are Jackson Pollack with an unlimited paint supply. Apply sauce to both sides flip often and alternate between top and bottom rack to avoid the sauce burning. Youll know they are done when you go to flip them and they just start to fall apart.

Add the onions and 1/4 tsp of salt and cook until slightly softened and translucent about 3-4 minutes. Next add the balsamic and the sugar reduce the heat to medium and cook until liquid is gone and the onions are soft and sweet about 15 minutes. Set aside. Prepare the Pancetta Arrange the pancetta in a single layer on a tray and place in the freezer. Along with the pancetta place the blades of your food processor in the freezer to chill. Let chill for 20-30 min until the meat is firm but not frozen solid. Prepare the Meat Remove the pancetta and processor blade from the freezer and quickly pulse the pancetta 5-8 times until finely ground. Mix the pancetta into the ground beef and stir well to combine. If its difficult to mix the pancetta evenly into the beef you can transfer the entire mixture back into the processor and pulse once or twice to combine. Form the Patties Preheat the oven to 230 degrees. Transfer the meat onto a baking sheet and form into four six ounce patties approximately four inches across. Be careful not to pack the patties too tightly they should be formed just well enough so that theyll hold together. Season each patty liberally on both sides with salt and pepper and then press three fingers of each hand into the top of each patty to form a slight indent. Bake the Patties Transfer the baking pan into the preheated oven and bake until theyve reached an internal temperature of at least 135 degrees to just below your desired doneness approximately 30 minutes. Prepare the Spread Transfer the two tablespoons of room temperature butter to a small bowl and beat with a hand mixer until smooth and fluffy. Drizzle in the 2 tablespoons of olive oil as you continue to beat the mixture until all of the olive oil is incorporated. Transfer to a fridge while you continue prepping the burgers. Fry the Sage While the patties are in the oven heat all but one tablespoon of the canola oil in a small but deep sauce pan to between 350-375 degrees. Pat the sage leaves dry and using tongs carefully add them a couple at a time into the hot oil. Remove the leaves when theyve stopped bubbling about 30 seconds. Transfer the fried leaves to a paper towel lined plate to drain and set aside. The leaves will brown in the oil but the color will restore to a deep dark green as they cool. Grill the Bread Remove the olive oil and butter mixture from the fridge and very sparingly spread one side of each slice of bread with it. Grill the bread spread side first until lightly toasted then flip and just barely toast the unspread side. If you do not have a grill available you can either lightly toast the bread in a standard toaster and apply the spread after its been toasted or you can toast it under your ovens broiler. If your bread is much larger than your patties you may want to slightly trim it to fit. Fry the Patties Heat the remaining canola oil in a large heavy skillet on high heat until smoking. Add the patties to the pan working in batches so you dont overcrowd and cook until nicely browned -- 30 seconds to one minute. Flip the patties and top each one with a slice of swiss cheese cooking until the bottom is browned as well. Repeat until all patties are cooked. Assemble the Burgers Place each patty on the buttered side of a toasted slice of bread top with a tablespoon of the onion mixture one slice of each type of tomato and two fried sage leaves.

If you dont they will bleed as you cook them and all that good for your stuff leaks out into the water. Some will anyway and you can let the water cool and put it on your plants! Step 2 Youre going to need a huge pot or canner or a few pots for this. After washing the dirt off of the beets dump them in a pot and cover them with water. Let them cook until fork tender. The time on this varies because it depends on your pot size and the size of the beets which always vary regardless of when they were planted. Step 3 While the beets are cooking combine the water vinegar and pickling spices in another pot and let simmer. Step 4 After the beets are fork tender drain off the hot water and dump the beets into a sink or other vessel containing cold water. Cut the stems and root tail off and peel the beet. Most of them will peel as you squeeze the beet but you can use a paring knife if you have any bad spots or skin that sticks. Cut them into whatever size pieces or slices you want. Step 5 Make sure your canning jars have been sanitized in the dishwasher its preferable that they are warm out of the dishwasher. Add one teaspoon of salt (pickling iodized or sea salt) to each quart jar (1/2 teaspoon for pints). Fill the jars to the neck with beets and pour or ladle the warm pickling juices on top to the neck. Step 6 You should have had your lids simmering in water on the stove already but if you didnt put them on now. Take a damp clean dish cloth and wipe off the rims of the jars. Carefully take your lids out of the water (or use a magnetic lid wand) and place them on the jars. Finger tighten (use your left hand if youre right handed or vice versa) the rings onto the lids. Place in canning rack and place canning rack full of jars into a canner that already has warm water. Step 7 Add water to cover the tops of the jars in the canner. Put lid on water bath canner and let it come to a gentle boil (a rolling boil and cause the jars to bump into each other and crack). After it reaches that boil let it cook for 25 minutes. Step 8 After 25 minutes lift the rack and let it rest in canner. Pull the jars out using a jar lifter and place them on a towel on the counter with about an inch of space between them careful not to knock them into each other or tilt them. Let them cool and sit overnight. Youll hear the popping of the jars sealing themselves. If you have any the next morning that arent sealed youll be able to push the lid down and it will pop back up. Put those in the fridge and eat them within a week or just throw them out. The rest can be stored in the pantry for a year. You can either tighten the rings or take them off at this point but I leave them on to protect the lid from getting popped off. **special instructions Make sure you use NEW canning lids and inspect your jars for cracks or chips BEFORE using them. Old canning lids usually dont seal because the wax has been heated and reheated and cracks and chips can allow harmful bacteria to enter the jar and spoil the food.")

s=Step.new(recipe_id: 79, step: "Step 1 First cut the mango in line with the seed. The easiest way to look for the seed is to cut down the middle taking off the more rounder parts of the mango. The mango meat really wraps itself around the seed so (hopefully) it will be easy to tell. After cutting off the meat from the seed you should have two big halves of the mango. Take one half into the palm of your hand with the mango meat side-up and score the mango into small square shapes with a knife. (Be very careful in this process because it is easy to run the knife past the skin and cut your hand!) After scoring the mango push the skin in to create the shape above. Take your knife again and gently cut the cubes of mango into your bowl. Step 2 Repeat this process to the second half of the mango. Except with this half after cutting off the cubes finely dice the mango. Then add the diced mango into the same bowl as the cubed mango. Mix together. The reason for this is to allow the salsa to have a bit more texture. People commonly mistake salsa and pico de gallo to be the same thing but they are different in texture. The main difference is that salsa is more of a liquid/ puree while pico de gallo is very chunky with minimal liquid. Step 3 Take 1/2 a jalapeno and clean out the ribs and seeds to make it less spicy. The easiest way of doing this is to use a spoon to scrape out the inside of the jalapeno. Finely dice your jalapeno after cleaning it out. Step 4 Finely dice 1/2 a red onion. Add to the bowl of mango along with the finely diced jalapeno. Add the juice of 1 lime. To get the most amount of juice out of a lime press and roll it against the counter or cutting board with the palm of your hand before cutting into it.

You want it flexible. Remove bacon from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Then slice it into ribbons the short way. Dont discard the bacon grease!!!! Step 2 At the same time cut each tomatoe in half and place them on a baking sheet. Rub the tomatoes with the olive oil salt and pepper and place them in the oven with the bacon. After 10 minutes turn the tomatoes and cook for another 10 minutes. They should be done about the same time as the bacon. Step 3 Slice the leek into rounds and put in a colander. Run water over the leek to remove any dirt. Pat dry (or use a salad spinner!). Saut the leek in butter til its translucent. Step 4 Cut the Brie into 12 chunks roughly one inch long and half an inch thick. (This part isnt rocket science. No need to get your kids ruler out of their backpack). Remove the rind from each piece. Step 5 Put a dollop of Dijon on each Brie chunk and spread it evenly over the top of the cheese. Put about one slice of bacon on top of the mustard and then top with about a tsp. of leeks and 2 slices of tomatoe. Step 6 Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Add the rendered bacon grease to the butter. Step 7 Remove the phyllo from the fridge and lay it on top of a piece of plastic or parchment. Put another piece of plastic or parchment over the top of the phyllo and put a damp towel on top of that. This should keep your phyllo from drying out. With a pastry brush liberally brush some butter/bacon grease mixture over the bottom of a baking sheet. Lay one sheet of phyllo on the down and brush it with butter/bacon grease. (Make sure youve re-covered the remaining phyllo with the parchment and towel). Fold the sheet of phyllo the long way and brush with butter again. Step 8 Put about half a slice of bacon ribbons about 2 inches up from the bottom of the phyllo. Top that with one of the dressed cheese chunks. Now fold the bottom of the phyllo up over the entire thing and roll it all the way up to the other end. Tuck the ends under and put the bundle seam side down. Brush the top with butter. Now repeat the process for the remaining 11 bundles. Dont worry if a piece of phyllo rips or isnt exactly flush with the other sheets. Phyllo is delicate but its also very forgiving as long as you use a lot of butter. Step 9 Place the bundlers in the oven (that youve kept on this entire time) for 10-15 minutes or until the tops of the bundles are beautifully browned. Serve immediately.")

Make sure that the potatoes are cleaned with cold water before you continue. Step 2 - SECRET Put the potatoes into a microwavable bowl and soften them by microwaving it for 3 to 5 minutes depending on your microwave. This is the secret because they are soften up when you fry them and they dont burn because you dont have to fry them as long. The reason why they get burnt is because the inside of the potato takes longer to cook than the outside so when you heat them up it makes the inside soft. Step 3 - Frying Add the oil to the pan. Put the soften potatoes in a pan after the oil is hot. Fry until the potatoes look like a little crispy on the edges but not too crispy. Then turn down to low heat and fry for 1 more minute. After that turn off the stove pour out the oil and let the potatoes sit for 5 minutes. Add potatoes to bowl and add the pepper to them. If you want add salt. Step 4 - Preparing and Enjoying In a mini cup add the melted butter for people to drizzle over the potatoes.

s=Step.new(recipe_id: 98, step: "Step 1: Make the Bacon Toffee Preheat oven to 350. Line a baking sheet with foil and lay out the bacon on the foil. Top each strip of bacon with a good layer of brown sugar. Place in oven. When the bacon starts to get brown but it is not yet cooked completely flip the bacon over using tongs and coat the other side with another generous layer of bacon. Watch the bacon carefully. You do not want it to burn but you do want it dark as the bacon fat is working with the sugar to caramelize it and turn it into candy/toffee. The whole process should take anywhere from 35 to 45 minutes. Remove the bacon from the sheet pan and let it cool on a plate. When it is cool break it into small bits about 1/4 squares as smaller chips are better in the ice cream. Step 2: Make the Ice Cream Split the vanilla bean scrape out the seeds and put the seeds and pod into a small sauce pan. Pour in the milk and turn the heat on to medium low. When milk starts to form small bubbles along the edge turn off the heat. Remove the pod and add the sugar stirring to dissolve the sugar into the milk. Pour the sugar vanilla milk mixture into a small bowl and set in the refrigerator for a couple of hours or until well chilled. When the mixture is well chilled remove from refrigerator and add the heavy cream. Using a hand mixer on low or a whisk beat the mixture for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. This will make sure the liquids are thoroughly combined and whip a bit of air into the mixture to produce a fluffier ice cream. DO NOT OVER BEAT. Pour mixture into your ice cream maker and proceed as per the manufacturers directions. 5 minutes before the ice cream is done add the bacon toffee chips. You can reserve some to serve on top of the ice cream if you want or put it all into the almost frozen ice cream. When the ice cream is done transfer it to a freezer safe container and let it sit for a couple of hours in the freezer to allow the ice cream to set up. Step 3: Making Salted Bacon Caramel Sauce *I make an appetizer called pig candy which are lil smokies wrapped in bacon topped with brown sugar and baked for an hour. Half way through the baking I pour off the liquid and fat that has collected in the pan flip the pig candy over and continue to bake until golden brown and crisp. I then separate the fat from the bacon juice and keep both in the refrigerator. You can make this recipe without the bacon juice. It just wont be quite as bacon in flavor. If you omit the bacon juice use 1/2 cup of cream. Mix all of the ingredients in a medium sauce pan over medium low heat. Cook while whisking gently for 6-8 minutes until thicker. Do not let the sauce boil as it will turn it into more of a chewy caramel rather than a sauce. If you dont want any bacon flavor in your caramel replace the bacon fat with the same amount of butter (4 TBSP). If you are not using the bacon juice use 1/2 cup of cream. Serve warm over the ice cream or refrigerate until needed. You can pop it into a microwave oven for 45 seconds to warm it up and drizzle it over the ice cream.")

I use my Small Big Green Egg Smoker. You can also cook in your oven if you dont have a Smoker or Grill. Step 2-Prepare the Chicken Remove neck and giblets from cavity of chicken if the chicken came with them. Rub the chicken all over with olive oil. Make sure the Mango can is open and only half-filled with juice (drink the other half!) Lower the chicken on to the open can so that the chicken is sitting upright with the can in its cavity. Place the chicken on the cool side of the grill using the legs and beer can as a tripod to support the chicken on the grill and keep it stable. I placed my chicken on top of the BGE and closed the lid.

Brush on BBQ Sauce and check the chicken every 15 minutes or so until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 160F - 165F. The total cooking time will vary depending on the size of your chicken and the internal temperature of the grill. A 4 lb chicken will usually take around 1 1/2 hours. If you dont have a meat thermometer a way to tell if the chicken is done is to poke it deeply with a knife (the thigh is a good place to do this) if the juices run clear not pink the chicken is done. Carefully transfer the chicken to a tray or pan. Use tongs to hold the top of the chicken. Lift the chicken beer can still inside and move it to a tray. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes. Carefully lift the chicken off of the can. If it gets stuck lay the chicken on its side and pull out the can with tongs. ENJOY OVEN OPTION You can also roast a chicken this way in the oven.

Microwave until thin warm and pourable. About 30-45 seconds. Stir well. 4. Holding cake over large bowl using handfuls of crushed cookies gently push crumbs into sides of cake.

Gardein Fish Fillet microwaved on low for about 30 seconds then dice it.

The mixture should be creamy enough to easily mix in if not you can add more silken tofu or a *tiny* amount of Vegan mayonnaise (my favorite is Just Mayo). Be careful with this though because it can affect the taste. Cook Preheat oil in deep frying pan at medium heat I used enough canola oil to almost fully submerge the Rangoon.

Place about one spoonful of the cream cheese mixture at the center of the wonton then fold over with fingers I used warm tap water on my fingertips to seal the wonton. It can take some extra manipulation to get them to stick but even if they dont fully stick its okay.

If the mixture doesnt come together into a ball gradually add more water until the dough will form a cohesive ball. Knead and Rest the Dough Flour your work surface and knead the dough until its a firm shiny relatively dry ball -- adding more flour as necessary.

Roll the Dough Divide the dough into four parts leaving the rest wrapped tightly as you work with one part as a time. If you have a pasta roller roll the pasta through starting on the largest setting and working down to the thinnest setting. If you do not have a pasta machine use a rolling pin to roll it out as thin as you can get it without it tearing -- the dough should be paper thin. Form the Ravioli If you have a ravioli plate follow the manufacturers directions to form and fill the pasta. If you do not have a plate lay a piece of rolled out dough on a well floured cutting board and use a paring knife to lightly mark off a grid of 1inch x 1inch squares -- as many as will fit on the piece of dough. In the center of each square place a scant tsp of the ricotta mixture being careful not to overfill. Place a second sheet of rolled dough on top of the sheet with the ricotta and carefully press around the filling to ensure their are no air bubbles.With a sharp paring knife cut over the grid lines you traced previously the use the tines of a fork to crimp the edges closed making sure theyre completely sealed.

Reserve one-third of the marinade to top fish after cooking. Make sure to remove pin bones from the salmon. Place salmon in marinade and let sit for up to but not more than 12 hours. Recommended marinade time is 4 - 12 hours. More than 12 hours may result in the lemon in the marinade cooking the fish. If you leave the skin on the salmon place the salmon in the marinade skin side up so the meat is in the brine. Directions for Smoking on the Grill: Smoking the salmon will give it a wonderful taste particularly if you are using a wild caught salmon. To smoke the fish place hot coals on one side of your charcoal grill. Use a mild wood like alder or pecan. Place wood on coals to start smoke. Place fish on other side of the grill. Cover grill to retain smoke flavor. Cook until salmon is tender and flaky but not over cooked. About 15 - 20 minutes. If you cook the salmon with the skin on place the salmon on the grill skin side down and do not turn the salmon during the cooking process. The skin will peel off easily when the salmon is cooked. The salmon should be a light pink and be slightly opaque (medium rare) when cooked properly. Top with reserved marinade and serve with lemon wedges and garnish with dill sprigs. Oven Directions: Heat oven to 350. Line baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place a rack on top of the baking sheet and foil. Bake fish skin side down if the salmon has its skin on for 5 - 10 minutes depending on the thickness of the filet. Tail end filets require less cooking time than filets from the head and center sections of the fish. When fish is a light pink and slightly opaque (medium rare) remove from oven.

Pour it over the dry ingredients and stir them to combine. Once the mixture is a craggy uneven mass knead it until smooth about a minute. Place the dough back in the bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Set it aside for an hour (or in the fridge up to 3 days) until needed. Prepare Filling Put potatoes into a large pot cover with cold water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and cook until soft about 20 to 25 minutes. Drain then transfer to a large bowl to cool. Fill a medium bowl with very cold water and drop in leek rings. Swish them around with your fingers letting any sandy dirt fall to the bottom. Scoop out the leeks and drain them briefly on a towel but no need to get them fully dry. Do the same with the kale but you can leave the leaves to nearly fully dry patting them if necessary on the towels while you cook the leeks. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Once hot add butter and oil and once theyre fully melted and a bit sizzly add the leek slices. Reduce heat to low cover with a lid and cook leek for 20 minutes stirring occasionally. Raise heat back to medium add the kale ribbons and cook until they wilt about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to bowl with potatoes add the cream cheese and mash together until combined. Stir in salt and many grinds of black pepper and set filling aside. Assembly Part 1 Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat your oven to 375 degrees. If your dough has sweated some beads of oil while it rested fear not you can just knead it back into an even mass. Divide the dough in half. On a well-floured surface roll the first half of the dough into a very thin sheet roughly in the shape of a 1-foot square but really no need to be rigid about it. For moderate size knish (smaller than the traditional doorstops but still hefty about 3 inches across) create a 2-inch thick log from half your potato filling across the bottom of your dough. Roll the filling up in the dough like you were rolling a cigarette but not too tight. A tiny amount of slack will keep the dough from opening in the oven. Keep rolling until the log has been wrapped twice in dough. Trim any unrolled length and add it to the second half of the dough; it can be used again. Repeat the process with the second half of your dough and second half of filling; you might have a small amount of dough leftover. Assembly Part 2 Trim the ends of the dough so that theyre even with the potato filling. Then make indentations on the log every 3 to 3 1/2 inches (youll have about 3 if your log was 1 foot long) and twist the dough at these points as if you were making sausage links. Snip the dough at each twist then pinch one of the ends of each segment together to form a sealed knish base. Use the palm of your hand to flatten the knish a bit into a squat shape and from here you can take one of two approaches to the top: You can pinch together the tops as you did the bottom to seal them; indenting them with a small dimple will help keep them from opening in the oven. You can gently press the dough over the filling but leave it mostly open. Bake Knish Arrange knish on prepared baking sheet so that they dont touch. Whisk egg yolk and water together to form a glaze and brush it over the knish dough. Bake knish for about 45 minutes rotating your tray if needed for them to bake into an even golden brown color. Let them cool a little bit before digging in. Spicy mustard is a traditional accompaniment but you can use a dollop of sour cream too.")

ALSO CLEAN PEEL AND SLICE 4 PEACHES. Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Prepare cake pans with nonstick baking spray. 2. Presift your cake flour at least for times in a separate bowl. This is CRUCIAL that you ONLY use CAKE FLOUR!!!!! Otherwise your cake will be dense and dry. Measure 2 cups of cake flour after you have sifted at least 4 times and it becomes very airy and silky. (There is a huge difference between self-rise flour and cake flour. Please be sure your box says cake flour). 3. With the measured cake flour in a sifter add baking powder baking soda and salt. Sift together in a bowl and set aside for later use. 4. Using an electric mixer beat butter on high until smooth and creamy. 5. Add sugar mix on medium-high to high for at least 2 minutes until fluffy and light in color. (This is critical to making your cake fluffy with lots of tiny holes). Scrap sides. 6. Mix in vanilla pudding. Scrap sides. 7. Mix in eggs then add vanilla. Scrap sides. 8. Starting with dry mix slowly add a small amount at a time into the wet batter. Then alternate with the buttermilk. Continue alternating dry with buttermilk until you end with the dry ingredients. ANOTHER CRITICAL MOMENT: DO NOT OVERMIX!!!!!!! Over mixing at this point causes gluten to form and then your cake will shrink. AS SOON AS YOU NO LONGER SEE WHITE FLOUR STOP MIXER AND INCORPORATE THE REST BY HAND. MAKE SURE TO SCRAP SIDES AND BOTTOM. 9. After batter is thoroughly mixed fill each cake pan with 1 cup of batter ( for 4inch circle). Pick up and drop the cake pan a couple of inches from the counter top to allow the large air bubbles to escape. 10. Bake 18-22 minutes until tops are domed and tops are a light golden brown. Top should also spring back when pushing in gently with finger. 11. Allow to cool in pan about 5-10 minutes then move to a bakers rack to finish cooling. 12. While cakes are cooling prepare peach butter rum glaze. For peach butter rum glaze Ingredients: 4 cleaned peeled and sliced peaches 1/3 cup granulated sugar 2/3 cup packed brown sugar 1/3 cup water 1/4 cup salted butter 1 tsp cinnamon 3 tbsp dark rum (brand of your choice) Directions: 1. In a medium pot on medium-high heat place peaches sugars cinnamon and water. 2. Bring to a boil and stir multiple times so it doesnt burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. 3. After previous ingredients are well combined and mixture is bubbling add in the salted butter. 4. Mix well and allow to cook 9-10 minutes. Stirring frequently. 5. Remove from heat and stove top. Add in rum and stir well. 6. Allow mixture to cool down to a warm temperature. 7. Place all of this mixture with the sliced peaches still swimming in a large bowl. Try to avoid consuming the entire pot before assembling your dessert! For stabilized vanilla whipped cream Ingredients: 1 tsp clear imitation vanilla extract 1/2 cup powdered sugar 2 cups heavy cream 4 marshmallows ( I will explain in a moment) Directions: 1. Bring out your mixing bowl and beaters that were in the freezer. 2. Put in cream sugar clear vanilla. 3. Beat on medium to medium high speed until it becomes thick. You MUST be careful to not overbeat otherwise it WILL become butter and separate! As soon as it is getting thick and starts resembling whipped cream turn mixer to LOW. 4. Turn mixer off and take the marshmallows on a microwavable plate and microwave them until they enlarge and are soft usually 20-30 seconds. 5. Turn mixer on low and mix in the warm marshmallows. After they are mixed turn mixer off and taste that creamy goodness! We add marshmallows to our whipped cream to give it stability. It is a shortcut rather than using gelatin. Marshmallows are quick usually on hand and have just enough gelatin to get the job done. Assembly 1. Take each 4 cake and cut of the domed top. This allows for that yummy glaze to get sucked right into that sponge! Plus the peaches sit prettier. 2. Take the sliced cakes and dip the tops right into the bowl of peach butter rum glaze. I dipped mine 3 times! 3. With a slotted spoon drain about 1/4-1/3 cup of peaches and place on top of the soaked cake. 4. Take the whipped cream out of the refrigerator and with an ice cream scoop scoop a nice sized helping on top of peaches. 5. Place a single peach slice on top of whipped cream. 6. With a spoon drizzle some of the glaze on top and sprinkle with a bit of cinnamon sugar! There you have it folks! My twisted version of the souths peaches and cream meets peach cobbler.

s=Step.new(recipe_id: 394, step: "Step 1: Make the Cake Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Use the butter to grease the bottom and sides of an 8 wide by 3 deep spring-form cake pan. Use a stand mixer with the whisk attachment to to whip the egg whites on medium speed for about 2 minutes until they become frothy. Slowly add 2/3 cup of sugar and increase the mixing speed to medium-high. Whip for an additional 2-3 minutes until the mixture is twice its size. Turn off the mixer and add the egg yolks one at a time mixing in between only enough to incorporate each egg yolk. Remove the bowl from the mixer and fold 1/2 cup of cocoa powder in with a rubber spatula. Transfer the batter to the buttered cake pan and bake at 325 degrees for about 30 minutes or until an inserted butter knife comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and allow to cool before removing from the pan. Step 2: Make the Chocolate Cream Using an electric or stand mixer with the whisk attachment combine 2 cups heavy whipping cream and 1/4 cup cocoa powder. Add the coffee liqueur and whip on high speed until very stiff peaks form. Refrigerate until ready to use. Step 3: Make the Bacon Macadamia Brittle In a large skillet cook the chopped bacon for 7-10 minutes on medium heat until crispy stirring occasionally. Strain the bacon with a slotted spoon and transfer it to a large bowl thats been lined with a paper towel. Set aside. Next line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper. Spread the macadamia nuts out on the cookie sheet. Evenly sprinkle the cooked bacon in with the macadamia nuts. Set aside. In a small saucepan melt 1 cup sugar until it is a light amber in color stirring occasionally about 5 minutes. When the sugar is melted pour it evenly over the bacon and macadamia nuts. Its okay if some of the nuts/bacon arent coated in the syrup this will make for lots of different sweet & salty bites! Refrigerate until the sugar hardens and forms the brittle about 10 minutes. Remove the mixture from the refrigerator and crush it with a kitchen mallet making small bite size pieces. Set the mixture aside until ready to serve. Step 4: Make the Chocolate Ganache In a small saucepan combine the remaining 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and the chocolate chips. Stir on medium heat for about 5 minutes until the mixture is thick smooth combined and melted. Remove from the heat and place a sheet of plastic wrap over the top of the ganache to prevent skin from forming on the top. Allow it to cool until ready to use. Step 5: Assemble the Cake Remove the cake from the pan and place it upside down on a serving dish so the flat even bottom of the cake becomes the top layer. Slice the cake through the center horizontally creating two 1.5 layers. Set the top layer aside and coat the bottom layer with the Chocolate Cream creating a 1.5 center filling. Place the top layer of the cake on top of the cream. Pour the ganache slowly on top of the cake until it coats the top completely and runs a bit over the sides. Use the remaining chocolate ganache to spoon around the sides of the cake to coat it completely. Use handfuls of the crushed Bacon Macadamia Brittle to coat the sides of the cake and stick to the chocolate ganache. Sweep away the extra brittle with your hands and use a wet paper towel to clean any remaining spilled chocolate ganache from the serving dish. Garnish with the edible tropical flowers and refrigerate until ready to serve.")

s=Step.new(recipe_id: 395, step: "For the cake Ingredients: For the cake: 1/2 cup unsalted butter softened 1 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup instant vanilla pudding (half the box) 2 eggs 1 tsp pure vanilla extract 1 cup buttermilk 3/4 tsp baking powder 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/2 tsp salt 2 cups cake flour (presifted at least 4 times BEFORE measured) Directions: BEFORE STARTING THIS RECIPE: PLACE A MIXING BOWL AND BEATER IN THE FREEZER SO IT WILL BE VERY COLD FOR MAKING THE STABILIZED WHIPPED CREAM. 1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Prepare cake pans with nonstick baking spray. 2. Presift your cake flour at least for times in a separate bowl. This is CRUCIAL that you ONLY use CAKE FLOUR!!!!! Otherwise your cake will be dense and dry. Measure 2 cups of cake flour after you have sifted at least 4 times and it becomes very airy and silky. (There is a huge difference between self-rise flour and cake flour. Please be sure your box says cake flour). 3. With the measured cake flour in a sifter add baking powder baking soda and salt. Sift together in a bowl and set aside for later use. 4. Using an electric mixer beat butter on high until smooth and creamy. 5. Add sugar mix on medium-high to high for at least 2 minutes until fluffy and light in color. (This is critical to making your cake fluffy with lots of tiny holes). Scrap sides. 6. Mix in vanilla pudding. Scrap sides. 7. Mix in eggs then add vanilla. Scrap sides. 8. Starting with dry mix slowly add a small amount at a time into the wet batter. Then alternate with the buttermilk. Continue alternating dry with buttermilk until you end with the dry ingredients. ANOTHER CRITICAL MOMENT: DO NOT OVERMIX!!!!!!! Over mixing at this point causes gluten to form and then your cake will shrink. AS SOON AS YOU NO LONGER SEE WHITE FLOUR STOP MIXER AND INCORPORATE THE REST BY HAND. MAKE SURE TO SCRAP SIDES AND BOTTOM. 9. After batter is thoroughly mixed fill each cake pan with 1 cup of batter ( for 4inch circle). Pick up and drop the cake pan a couple of inches from the counter top to allow the large air bubbles to escape. 10. Bake 18-22 minutes until tops are domed and tops are a light golden brown. Top should also spring back when pushing in gently with finger. 11. Allow to cool in pan about 5-10 minutes then move to a bakers rack to finish cooling. 12. While cakes are cooling prepare peachy pecan pie filling. For the peachy pecan pie filling Ingredients: 6 tbsp salted butter 1 3/4 cup packed brown sugar 1/4 cup dark corn syrup 4 fresh peaches cleaned peeled and chopped (save a few whole slices for garnishes) 1 tbsp cinnamon 3 cups chopped pecans 3 tbsp dark rum Directions: 1. In a medium pot over medium-high heat melt butter brown sugar and dark corn syrup. 2 Mix well until all ingredients are combined and add chopped peaches and cinnamon. 3. Allow mixture to boil about 7 minutes. Then remove from stove. 4. Add rum and mix well. 5. Stir in chopped nuts. 6. Allow to cool for filling to thicken. You may hurry the process by setting it in the freezer for awhile. 7. The filling will become thick and scoopable the cooler it gets. For stabilized vanilla whipped cream Ingredients: 1 tsp clear imitation vanilla extract 1/2 cup powdered sugar 2 cups heavy cream 4 marshmallows ( I will explain in a moment) Directions: 1. Bring out your mixing bowl and beaters that were in the freezer. 2. Put in cream sugar clear vanilla. 3. Beat on medium to medium high speed until it becomes thick. You MUST be careful to not overbeat otherwise it WILL become butter and separate! As soon as it is getting thick and starts resembling whipped cream turn mixer to LOW. 4. Turn mixer off and take the marshmallows on a microwavable plate and microwave them until they enlarge and are soft usually 20-30 seconds. 5. Turn mixer on low and mix in the warm marshmallows. After they are mixed turn mixer off and place bowl in refrigerator to ease scooping. Assembly 1. Slice the dome off of each mini cake. 2. With a slotted spoon drizzle the peachy pecan pie filling sauce on top of the cut top of the cake. Place on serving dish. 3. Place a heaping scoop of peachy pecan pie filling on top of soaked cake. 4. With a large ice cream scoop next put a dollop of whipped cream. 5. Garnish with a peach slice and a couple of whole pecans. And using the slotted spoon (you may have to slightly reheat filling in microwave for it to drizzle) drizzle a bit of the filling on top of the cream as well.")

Remove to a bowl leaving any oil they released in the pan. Saute the chicken for 2-3 minutes or until golden. It will cook further in the stock later on its just important to brown at this stage not necessarily cook all the way through. Remove to the bowl with the chorizo. If there is some oil left in the pan from the chorizo and chicken leave it there to saut the prawns. If not add a little of the olive oil. Saute the prawns briefly until slightly golden and just cooked through. Remove from the pan. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat bring the chicken stock to the boil with the saffron added. Once boiling reduce the heat to a very low simmer. Place the onion pepper and garlic in a food processor and puree until smooth. This is called the Soffrito which is the flavor base for the paella. Add the olive oil to the pan and then the soffrito. Stir until most of the moisture has evaporated. This will take about five minutes. The mixture will start to crackle and become more paste-like when it is ready. Add the paprika and stir for a further minute. Add the rice and stir to coat with the soffrito. Pour in about a third of the stock and stir to mix everything together. Add the chicken and chorizo and distribute evenly in the pan. Add can of tomatoes. Pour in the rest of the stock and reduce the heat to very low. Nestle the clams and mussels hinge-side down into the rice. Cook for around 40 minutes on low heat. Dont stir it and move the pan around on the element to make sure there is even heat distribution. As time goes by the rice absorbs the liquid the shellfish open and a crust should form on the bottom and around the sides of the pan. The dish is ready when the rice is cooked through. Arrange the prawns around the pan and cover with foil. Remove from the heat and rest for a few minutes covered.

Wrap strips of waxed paper around the cake round bottoms to create a mold/form and secure with tape. Spread half of the strawberry jam on top of cake. Slice strawberries and place around the edges of the wax paper forms being careful not to overlap. It should take 4 or 5 slices to go around the inside of the mold. Carefully pipe coconut filling into molds making sure that strawberry slices are visible on the outside. Fill molds just to tops of strawberries. Top with remaining cake rounds pressing lightly to make sure cream is packed tightly into molds. Spread remaining strawberry jam over cake tops. Chill for at least one hour.

Let it rest for 5 minutes then add the salt and shake gently. Add the flour and olive oil (only if you are making pizza) and mix until you can knead it with your hands. The dough should stick a little but for the first few kinutes but will then form itself into a ball with more kneading and folding. Once it is formed into a ball dump it onto a lightly flours wooden surface and knead for exactly 12 minutes. If making bread do not add flour or water until at least the eigth minute of kneading. Once the ball of dough is smooth place it in a lightly floured or oiled bowl cover with a clean dish towel and let rise in a warm (80 degrees Fahrenheit) place such as inside a turned-off oven for 2 hours. Punch down the dough after 1 hour cover and let rise for another hour. For more flavor let the rising process go on longer: cover the dough with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight (this is called a cold rise) but let the dough return to room temperature before working on it again. Now it is ready for making into a pizza. If you are making bread go on to step 5 otherwise use this dough for any recipes calling for a Basic Bread and Pizza Dough. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit. Transfer the dough to a baking stone form into the shape you wish and score with a razor blade or very sharp knife. Place a pan of water in the bottom of the oven then the loaf on the baking stone on the center rack. If you have another baking stone or baking tiles you can line some in the oven for better tasting a textured bread. Reduce the oven temperature to 45 degrees Fahrenheit and bake until golden brown on top about 40 minutes spraying it with water at first. Let cool on a wire rack before slicing. Pizza Prepare the pizza dough. Divide the dough into two balls and let rise as instructed. Preheat the oven to 555 degrees Fahrenheit with a large baking stone and let it stay at that temperature for 30 minutes Roll or stretch the dough out until 16 inches in diameter using either a rolling pin on a lightly floured work surface or by rotating the pizza while its draped over your fist until about inch thick. Place each crust on a 16-inch solid pizza pan or the baking stone sprinkled with cornmeal to prevent sticking or use a 16-inch perforated pizza pan making sure the border of the dough is a little higher than the center. Make indentations all over the pizza with your fingertips and grease the top including the borders with olive oil. Sprinkle to Parmesan evenly over the two pizzas leaving a 1-inch border all around then evenly distribute the tomatoes and mozzarella. Lay the basil leaves over the top and oil the top again. Season with salt and pepper. Bake until the borders are charred in place and the top is dappled brown in certain place on the cheese 8 to 9 minutes.

s=Step.new(recipe_id: 634, step: "Step 1: Prep the Vegetables Prepare all of the vegetables before browning the ground beef. This allows for a smooth cooking process only involving one person cooking. Leave the vegetables on the cutting board until it is time to place them into the pot. Step 2: Brown the Meat Coat the bottom of the pot with extra virgin olive oil then place the pound of lean ground beef into the pot. Brown the meat thoroughly. Hint: If youre a person who doesnt like a lot of fat in their meals like myself sprinkle some salt onto the ground beef to release some of those fatty juices so they may be poured into something disposable like an empty can. DO NOT POUR THE FAT/GREASE DOWN THE DRAIN IT MAY CLOG YOUR PIPES ONCE IT COOLS DOWN! Step 3: Adding the Vegetables The first vegetable you will want to add to the pot once the meat is browned is the diced green peppers. Green peppers are hard and crunchy so you will want to saute them in the meat first. Wait about 5 to minutes to add the other ingredients while continuing to stir the peppers. Add the sliced squash and zucchini after that time since they have about the same consistency. Add the halved olives into the pot as well. It is very important to add the olives in the beginning stages of this spaghetti sauce because black olives can be kind of squeaky if they are under cooked in the sauce. Let the vegetables sit to saute while being covered occasionally stirring for about 8-10 minutes. Be sure to include the garlic salt and Italian seasonings to the meat and vegetable mixture. Add any other spices deemed necessary. Step 4: Add the Sauce For this recipe I chose not to use a bottle of spaghetti sauce because I am creating my own. This is very important for people who have a gluten allergy it allows them to know EXACTLY what is going into this spaghetti. Add the tomato paste to the vegetables and beef. Add the two cans of tomato sauce (they typically look like little half cans). Add the can of diced tomatoes (the tomatoes may be accompanied by green chilies onions or just by themselves your call). Stir all of that deliciousness up and let it sit covered for about 10 minutes. Dont forget to stir! At first it may look as though there is not enough sauce for all of those vegetables but just wait everything will cook down and it will be plenty. Step 5: Spaghetti Time! Begin to boil the water for the spaghetti. The sauce is done so move it to the burner behind it to let it cool. In this recipe Ive used an all natural vegetable spaghetti noodle so that it doesnt contain any gluten. Look at the ingredients to the pasta noodles and if any say durum or semolina they contain gluten so put those down. I found these noodles at my local Kroger but they typically have them at any natural food store. If youre a person who cant find these special noodles just use regular ones; recipes are all about substitutions. Cook the noodles until done and enjoy The Famous Spaghetti!!")

s=Step.new(recipe_id: 636, step: "To make the cake: Heat oven to 300. Line the bottom of 2 - 9 cake pans with parchment paper. In the bowl of stand mixer with the whisk attachment add the cocoa and boiling water. Whisk on low until smooth. Add the butter and sour cream and blend on low until the butter is melted. Let cool for a few minutes if still very hot. Add eggs and vanilla. On medium speed blend until very smooth. Cool for 10 minutes. While the cocoa mixture is cooling sift together the flours sugar baking soda and salt. With the mixer on low add the dry ingredients to the cocoa mixture a little at a time. Scrape down the sides a couple of times. Increase the mixer speed to high and blend for 3 minutes. Divide the batter evenly between the cake pans using a kitchen scale if you have one or scoop with a measuring cup if not. Gently shake the pans so that the batter is smooth across the top. Bake on the center rack of your oven until the cake is firm in the middle and pulling away from the edges a bit. About 45 minutes - 1 hour. Cool completely on a cooling rack preferably overnight as it will make splitting them into layers easier if they have firmed up a bit. To make the frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment add the eggs and whisk on medium high until frothy. Add 6 Tbs of sugar and beat on high to medium peaks. It will be smooth and shiny and the peaks will curl a little. Stop the mixer. In a heavy bottomed medium saucepan over medium high heat add cup + 2 Tbs sugar and corn syrup. Cook while stirring gently until the sugar begins to melt then stop stirring and bring to a rolling boil. Remove from the heat. Turn the mixer on medium high. Slowly and steadily pour the syrup in keeping your stream on the edge of the bowl as to not allow it to touch the whisk. Do not scrape residual sugar out of the pan. Whisk on medium for 7 minutes. Add the butter 1 Tbs at a time. Scrape down the sides and add the melted chocolate. Blend until smooth and creamy scraping down the sides another time or two. To make the raspberry filling: In a small bowl stir together the raspberry jam and liquor until well blended. Assembly: Use a long serrated knife to carefully split the cakes in half. Slowly rotate the cake as you are slicing towards the center to ensure an even split. Place the bottom layer crumb side down on a flat serving platter or a cake stand lined with wax or parchment paper to help keep it clean while frosting and garnishing. Top the bottom layer with about 1 cups of frosting. Spread it evenly with a cake spatula to just shy of the cakes edge. Spread 1/3 of the raspberry jam mixture on top of the smooth side of the second layer of that cake. Carefully place it on top of the frosted layer jam side down. Repeat with the next two layers but be sure that the top layer has the smooth side up for the final frosting. Spoon about cup of the frosting into a small bowl. Spread it very thinly all over the cake top and sides with a cake spatula. You will be able to see the layers through this layer of frosting called a crumb coat. The crumb coat seals in cake crumbs so they dont mix in with the thicker final layer of frosting. Chill the cake for 20 minutes or until the crumb coat is firm. Do not refrigerate the remaining frosting while chilling. Scrape the remaining frosting onto the top of the cake. Spread evenly over the top and sides of the cake with a cake spatula. The finish will not be perfect but be sure to cover completely and uniformly. You dont want to be able to distinguish the layers from underneath the frosting. With the back of a teaspoon create little waves and flips over the top of the cake. To garnish: Working over a large surface area to catch the excess take handfuls of the chocolate chips and gently pat them into the sides of the cake. Remove the excess chips from your platter/cake plate. Cut away the excess wax/parchment paper by outlining the edge of the bottom of the cake by pressing the tip of a very sharp pairing knife through the paper. Once youve gone completely around the cake cut through the edge of the paper to the edge of the cake and then carefully pull the excess paper from around the cake. Arrange raspberries on the top of the cake.")
